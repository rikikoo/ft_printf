# ft_printf
**school project:** ** WIP ** C's printf re-written from scratch (in compliance with the 42 norm)

For the moment my ft_printf can
- print out types `c`, `s`, `p`, `d` or `i`, `f`, `u`, `o`, `x` and `X`
  - with lengths `h`, `hh`, `l`, `ll`, `L`
- handle field width and .precision
- use flags `+`, `-`, `#`, `0` and `space`

It *will* be able to do other types of conversions, support `$`, support `z`, have colours....
